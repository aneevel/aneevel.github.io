            <h2>Hi! I'm Alec</h2>
            <p>I'm a web software engineer living in Madison, Wisconsin.
               I like to work with the entire stack, handling anything from React (which this site is built on!)
               to SQL queries.
            </p>
            <p>I design and create websites, web applications, and more. I enjoy using modern technology to build applications 
                that my clients, family, and friends feel joy using.
            </p>
            <p>I've studied Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, and Web Software Development at Madison Area Technical College.
                In 2021, I completed my degree at Madison Area Technical College, and formally entered the world of professional software development.

                I'm always striving to learn more and put what I learn into practice. I have a sharp, analytical mind with strong
                creative tendencies that don't quit. If you're interested in learning more about me, or pursuing my efforts
                for your own technical needs, please read further!
